# Overview/Misson For Project

_This project will be very basic to complete the goals required of me but will be expanding upon as I decided to add features and update styling as my skillset progresses_

- Will be basic in terms of search parameters primarily
- Functionality wise it will not need much
  - A navbar consisting of
    - Watchlist
    - Top Rated Page
    - Search Page
    - Login (which becomes logout if the user is logged in)
  - Logo Which will be in the top left across from the navigation panel
  - Title/Header as a greeting to user
  - Sub-title/Paragraph tag under the the header that invites the user to search the database for a movie
  - A Search Input
  - A Section for search results
  - Footer with possibly a back to top button depending on styling of each movie card and how much of the page it takes styling wise (this may also be added later when we are not limiting our search results to 6 per directions)

# Writing my questions

- Which API will I use?
  - How do I get access?
  - What will be my API key?
  - What kind of data is stored about each movie?
  - What parts of this data will I actually render to the user's search results?
- What are the goals of my project vision wise?
- What will be required in the HTML structure?
- How many pages will I have?
  - What will be the purpose of each page?
- How do I create variables in CSS?
- What kind of search will I be using?
  - By year?
  - By genre?
  - By Title?
  - By a toggle like David's mock up to search within a given set of years set by the user? Should I do this in number form?
  - What is even available as the search methods for the API I will be using from their documentation?
- Will I need to use local storage for any persistent data that I can think of at the moment?
- What kind of websites will I use for visualizing functionality and UX?
